-- 1. Make a database for a company xyz 
CREATE DATABASE xyz;
USE xyz;

-- 2. Make an employee table in the xyz database. 
CREATE TABLE employee(
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT,
department VARCHAR(50),
city VARCHAR(50),
salary INT
);

-- Words in SQL can be written in whole word capital/small.

-- 3. Fill details in the table
INSERT INTO employee(id, name, age, department, city, salary)
VALUES
(1,"Rahul", 25, "IT","Mumbai",1500),
(2,"Afsara",26,"HR","Pune",2000),
(3,"Abhimanyu",27,"IT","Mumbai",2500),
(4,"Aditya",25,"Marketing","Surat",2400),
(5, "Raj",24,"Finance","Indore",1500);

-- 4. See all the data
Select * FROM employee;  -- *(Asterics) means all/all columns or data which is present in the table/all

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD dob VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT "np"; -- np means not present

Select * FROM employee;

ALTER TABLE employee
DROP COLUMN dob;

Select * FROM employee;

ALTER TABLE employee
MODIFY age VARCHAR(3);

Select * FROM employee;

ALTER TABLE employee
CHANGE age emp_age VARCHAR(3); -- can give new datatype else give old datatype of the column

Select * FROM employee;

ALTER TABLE employee
RENAME COLUMN emp_age TO age;

Select * FROM employee;

-- Schema is basically all the properties or attributes or characterstics of table which is displayed by the column.

-- renaming employee to employees
RENAME TABLE employee TO employees;
Select * FROM employee; -- will show ERROR
Select * FROM employees;

-- renaming name to emp_name
ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME COLUMN name TO emp_name;
Select * FROM employees;

-- renaming of database mostly depends on the server as server may or may not allow renaming of the database due to security risks involved and also there are several security requests and protocols which needs to be accepted before renaming of the database. 

-- Truncate means data present in the table is deleted and only the structure/schema of the table remains preserved.
 
CREATE TABLE salarydetails(
salary INT,
increment INT 
); 

INSERT INTO salarydetails(salary, increment)
VALUES
(1200,6),

SELECT * FROM salarydetails;
